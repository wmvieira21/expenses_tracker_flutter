# Expense tracker

# About
Developed an Expense tracker app using Flutter. It features a home screen where users can see their monthly expenses and a chart displaying which category (work, food, leisure, and travel) the user has been spending more money on. Furthermore, users can delete their expenses by swiping them to the left. Additionally, users can add new expenses by clicking on the (+) button in the app bar. This screen allows you to add a title, amount, and date for your new expense.
